# Dispatches 1914 changelog

Player-facing and rules-facing changes only (what a player or a balance check would notice). Newest first.
Add an entry in the same commit as the change. Engine changes live in packages/engine/CHANGELOG.md.
Format: version or date, then Fixed / Changed / Added. A change that moves the UI baseline must also be
listed in tests/baseline/known-diffs.json (see docs/WORKFLOW.md).

## 1.0.1 (2026-10-04)
### Fixed
- Seven ending screens of the German OHL campaign (the home front collapsing first, the front giving way, fighting on into 1919, an early negotiation, worse terms, an army that still exists, the east held and the west lost) showed the characters "\\n\\n" in the middle of their text instead of a paragraph break. The text is now broken into paragraphs as written.
### Added
- `check-text-integrity.js`, part of the validator suite: finds literal escape sequences, "undefined" or "NaN" interpolated into prose, doubled spaces and unclosed quotes in every string of every node. Run against 1.0.0 it reports exactly the seven endings above.

## 1.0.0 (2026-10-03): first public release
### Playable
- Three commands, each a branching graph of dated decisions with advisor positions, dossiers and bulletins: the German Oberste Heeresleitung (20 decisions), the French Grand Quartier Général (20) and the Russian Stavka (17), with 9 endings each (one per command is the hard-mode ending, see Known).
- BEF, AOK and the Ottoman command appear greyed out as "No content yet".
- Built for phones first: a column at most 600px wide, no sideways scrolling.
### Known
- The game keeps no saved state: closing the page ends the run.
- Hard mode exists in the rules (an erosion track with a forced ending per command) and is tested, but the menu has no switch for it yet.
- The historical claims have been checked by their author only; an independent fact-check is planned (see the game's CLAUDE.md).
### Changed
- The game is titled Dispatches 1914 on the title screen (File No. 1914) and in the page title; it used to say 1918.
### Quality
- All 54 decisions and endings are reachable (`npm run check:orphans`); 24 seeded playthroughs replay identically (`npm run verify:baseline`); the build loads cleanly in Chromium and WebKit on a phone and a desktop viewport.
- Fixed before release: the WAR RECORD card on the menu was wider than a phone screen (20px of sideways scrolling).
